# IPL-Winner-Prediction
AI/ML Group project on IPL Winner Prediction

⭐️The primary objective of this project is to predict the outcomes of IPL matches using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can analyse historical match data and provide accurate forecasts for future matches.The "IPL Win Predictor" leverages logistic regression to provide
insights into the probability of a team winning an IPL match. This model analyses various match features, team performance, and player statistics to offer real-time predictions.

# USAGE

prompted:
• Batting Team: The team currently at bat.
• Bowling Team: The team currently bowling.
• City: The location of the match.
• Current runs: The current score of batting team.
• Overs Completed: The number of overs completed.
• Wickets: The number of wickets lost.
• Target Runs: The total runs scored by a bowling team.

# LIBRARIES USED
This project leverages the following technologies:
• Python
• Numpy
• Pandas
